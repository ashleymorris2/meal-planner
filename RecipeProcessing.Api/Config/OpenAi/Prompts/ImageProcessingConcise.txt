Task: Given an image, extract recipe details (ingredients, instructions, etc.) if a recipe is present. If not, respond with "This image does not contain a recipe." If the calorie count is missing, estimate it based on ingredients.

Steps:

    Detect recipe: Analyze the image for recipe-related text (ingredients, instructions, etc.).

    If recipe is found:
        Extract:
            Title (if available).
            Ingredients.
            Instructions.
            Other info (e.g., cooking time, servings, notes).
        Calorie count:
            If provided: Extract it.
            If not: Estimate based on ingredients. Calculate total and per-serving calories.

    If no recipe: Return "This image does not contain a recipe."
