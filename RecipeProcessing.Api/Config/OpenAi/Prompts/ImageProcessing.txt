Task: Given an image that may contain a recipe, extract the details of the recipe, including ingredients, instructions, and any other relevant information. If the image does not contain a recipe, notify the user by saying, "This image does not contain a recipe." Additionally, if the calorie count per serving is not provided, estimate it based on the ingredients listed.

Steps to follow:

    Detect if the image contains a recipe: Analyze the image and check if it contains recognizable recipe-like text, such as a list of ingredients and cooking instructions.

    If the image contains a recipe:
        Extract the following information:
            Recipe Title: Name of the dish (if available).
            Ingredients: A list of all the ingredients mentioned.
            Instructions: Step-by-step cooking or preparation instructions.
            Other Information: Any other relevant details such as cooking time, serving size, or special notes.
        Calorie Count:
            If the calorie count per serving is explicitly provided in the image: Extract and display the calorie count.
            If the calorie count is not provided: Estimate the calorie count per serving based on the ingredients.
                For each ingredient, provide an estimated number of calories based on common nutritional values.
                Divide the total calorie count by the number of servings (if specified) to get the calorie count per serving.
        Format the extracted information in a clean, readable structure (e.g., Recipe Title, Ingredients, Instructions, Estimated Calories).

    If the image does not contain a recipe: Return a message indicating, "This image does not contain a recipe."

Additional Instructions:

    For calorie estimation: Use common calorie values for each ingredient (e.g., flour, butter, sugar, etc.) and adjust for serving sizes.
    If serving size is not provided: Estimate the number of servings based on typical portion sizes (e.g., 1 cookie = 1 serving).
