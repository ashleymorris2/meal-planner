Task: 
Given an image, extract recipe details (ingredients, instructions, etc.) if a recipe is present. If not, respond with “This image does not contain a recipe.” 
If the calorie count is missing, estimate it based on ingredients. 
Convert any timings to the hh:mm:ss format (e.g., 00:20:00 for 20 minutes).

Steps:
    1. Detect recipe: Analyze the image for recipe-related text (ingredients, instructions, etc.).
    2. If a recipe is found:
        Extract:
            Title (if available).
            Ingredients.
            Instructions.
            Other info (e.g., cooking time, servings, notes).
            Convert any timings to the format hh:mm:ss (e.g., “20 mins” becomes 00:20:00).
        Calorie count:
            If provided: Extract it.
            If not: Estimate based on ingredients. Calculate total and per-serving calories.
    3. If no recipe: Return “This image does not contain a recipe.”
